# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenSolvency are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to adhere to
semantic versioning once it reaches 1.0.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

First named release (graduated from the `opensolvency` placeholder). The kernel,
gate, audit chain, rails, agent loop, and the Networth-derived behavioural harness
were built across the preceding milestones; this release adds the production
hardening and integration surfaces.

### Added
- **Reference example agents** (`examples/`) — a key-free `shopping-agent.ts`
  demonstrating all four gate verdicts (auto-execute / park / block / injection-
  resistance), and an `ai-sdk-agent.ts` wiring `createGatedPayTool` into a real
  Vercel AI SDK agent. `npm run example:shopping`; the shopping flow is test-pinned.
- **CI spend-gating GitHub Action** (`action.yml`) — `uses: general-liquidity/
  opensolvency` routes a pipeline payment through the gate and fails the job unless
  it's authorized (e.g. an agent buying compute in CI can't spend outside mandates).
- **SpendTrust benchmark** (`src/benchmark/`) — "can your agent be trusted to
  spend?", the OpenSolvency analog to SharpeBench. An agent submits its decision log;
  `scoreSpendTrust` / `rankSpendTrust` grade it (A–F) on gate-respect, honest
  rationales, no doom-loops, and backing off on pending — deterministic and
  explainable. Retrying a blocked payment or an injected rationale **hard-fails**
  regardless of settled count (raw throughput is never the rank key). Ships a
  reference field (trustworthy / doom-looper / injector); CLI `benchmark`; SDK-exported.
- **JSON-RPC interface**, **multi-tenant isolation**, **versioned config** (above).
- **Audit-log export + standalone verifier** — `exportAuditChain` dumps the signed
  hash-linked chain to a portable file (jsonl/json); `verifyAuditExport(dump, key)`
  re-verifies it standalone (no store/executor), reusing the exact `AuditLog.verify`
  logic. CLI: `audit export` / `audit verify-export <file>`. (HMAC-symmetric — proves
  integrity to a key holder; asymmetric public verifiability is a noted future step.)
- **Versioned config schema + migration** — `src/config/schema.ts`: a zod-validated
  operator config carrying an explicit `version`, with `migrateConfig` forward-
  migrating older shapes (a missing version = pre-versioning v0, filled with
  defaults) before validation. Mirrors the mandate-lifecycle versioning discipline.
- **Framework integration adapters** (`@general-liquidity/opensolvency/integrations`)
  — a framework-agnostic `gatedPay` handler (+ shared name/description/zod schema)
  and a native Vercel AI SDK `createGatedPayTool`, so any agent framework (AI SDK,
  Mastra, LangChain, OpenAI Agents, CrewAI) gates its spend in one line.
- **Portable gate kernel** (`@general-liquidity/opensolvency/gate`) — `evaluateGate`
  plus its pure inputs with **zero `node:` dependencies**, so the same invariant runs
  in a browser / edge worker / other-language host. A test asserts the whole import
  graph stays node-free (chosen over a WASM port to keep one source of truth).
- **Property/fuzz tests on `evaluateGate`** — 2000 seeded random (intent, mandate-set)
  scenarios asserting the load-bearing invariants (deny-match ⇒ block; auto-execute ⇒
  a live covering mandate within its per-tx cap; no cover ⇒ never auto-execute).
- **Standalone MCP package** — `@general-liquidity/opensolvency-mcp`, an npx-able
  MCP server (`npx -y @general-liquidity/opensolvency-mcp`) so editors configure it
  like any other MCP server. It delegates to the main package's new `./mcp` subpath
  export (`startOpenSolvencyMcp`), which the bundled `opensolvency mcp` command now
  shares — one gated surface, two entry points. The package is scoped
  `@general-liquidity/opensolvency` (matching SharpeBench), publishable with
  `publishConfig.access: public`.
- **Real on-chain settlement path (testnet)** — `scripts/testnet-settle.ts` takes
  the system past the fail-safe stubs: a genuine ERC-20 stablecoin transfer (e.g.
  testnet USDC) executed by the same executor + gate, via a live `viem` wallet
  adapted to the repo's `OnchainSigner` seam (`viem` is a dev-only dep; the shipped
  package keeps the seam, not the wallet). Needs an operator-supplied funded testnet
  key. The gate runs for real — a unit test proves a *vetted* payee auto-executes
  (tx hash flows back as the receipt) while an *unvetted* one is blocked by the
  deny-list with the signer never called (money never moves).
- **Deployable runtime** — a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (non-root, `node:sqlite`,
  `/ready` healthcheck), `docker-compose.yml`, and `DEPLOY.md`. The `serve` command
  gained `--host` and now **fails closed**: binding a non-loopback interface without
  an ingress token is refused (the gate still governs spend, but the transport is
  never exposed unauthenticated). The token can be set via `OPENSOLVENCY_INGRESS_TOKEN`
  (ergonomic for containers) as well as `token set`.
- **Publishable on npm** — the `opensolvency` name is available; the build ships a
  clean ~168 kB tarball (dist + `.d.ts` + LICENSE/CHANGELOG/README, no dead maps).
- **Eval harness** (`src/evals/`) — the payments-domain analogue of Gordon's RULER
  harness. **Generated scenarios** (from the gate-acceptance spec + the deny-list,
  each `derivedFrom`-stamped) run **live** through a deterministic executor +
  `FakeRail`; **process checks** (`checkTrajectory`) replay the signed audit trace
  and fail on the catastrophic failures — settling a gate-blocked intent, settling
  with no gate decision, settling while halted; **pass^k** (`computePassK`,
  `mode "all"` for safety) demands every run be safe; an opt-in **LLM-judge** leg
  (`judge.ts`, with a deterministic stub) scores advisory quality. A deterministic
  **CI gate** (`npm run eval-gate`, a third CI job) blocks any regression, and
  `opensolvency evals` runs it locally.
- **Payments / HTTP hardening** — **idempotency keys** (`Idempotency-Key` header:
  a retried `POST /payment-intent` replays the first result and the gate runs once,
  so a network retry can't settle twice), a per-IP **rate limiter** (fixed-window,
  `429` + `Retry-After`), a **request body-size cap** (`413`), and a **`/ready`**
  readiness probe (distinct from `/health`). All documented in the OpenAPI doc.
- **Editor integration (ACP)** — an Agent Client Protocol stdio surface
  (`src/acp/`) so editors/IDEs can drive the gate-enforced finance agent in-editor,
  alongside the existing MCP server (Claude Code / Cursor) and HTTP ingress.
- **OpenAPI 3.1 document** served at `GET /openapi.json` describing the ingress
  surface for machine discovery.
- **Ingress authentication** — an operator-set bearer token gates the HTTP
  transport (`/health` always open); the surface stays open on loopback when no
  token is configured.
- **Operator notifications** — an injected `Notifier` seam (no-op default, console
  and webhook implementations) pings the operator out-of-band when a payment is
  routed to confirmation, so the pending queue need not be polled. Best-effort:
  it can never block or alter a gate decision.
- **OTLP tracer** — a real `Tracer` that ships executor lifecycle events to an
  OpenTelemetry collector over OTLP/HTTP (JSON), with no hard `@opentelemetry/*`
  dependency.
- **Postgres store** (`createPostgresStore`, exported from the SDK) — durable,
  server-grade persistence. Postgres is the source of truth; an in-process mirror
  serves the synchronous `Store` reads (so the gate stays pure and nothing else
  changes), and writes are persisted through a serialized queue with a `flush()`
  barrier the executor awaits (the new `commit` dep) so a payment's writes are
  durable before `execute()`/`approve()` resolves — no write-behind data-loss risk.
  The `pg` client is injected (operator brings `pg.Pool`).
- **Postgres multi-instance read coherence** — an optional `PgNotificationListener`
  seam (Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY): a store publishes its writes via `pg_notify` and
  refreshes its read mirror when another instance changes a mandate / intent /
  receipt / meta row, so secondary instances stay current without re-reading the
  whole table. Eventual (NOTIFY-latency) consistency; the signed audit chain stays
  single-writer (hash-linked), so writes route through one instance.
- Packaging: `LICENSE` (MIT), this changelog, and a publishable package manifest.
- **Publishable build** — `npm run build` compiles `src` → `dist` (ESM + `.d.ts`),
  rewriting `.ts` import specifiers to `.js` (TS `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`).
  `bin`/`main`/`types`/`exports` point at `dist`, `prepublishOnly` runs the build,
  and the package is no longer `private` — ready for `npm publish` once the name is
  claimed. CI now builds the dist on every run.
